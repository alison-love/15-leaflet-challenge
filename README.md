# Earthquake and Tectonic Plate Visualization

## Overview
This project is a web-based interactive map that visualizes earthquake data and tectonic plate boundaries. Users can explore recent earthquake occurrences and observe the relationship between earthquakes and tectonic plate boundaries.


The Earthquake and Tectonic Plate Visualization project uses Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps, to display earthquake data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) and tectonic plate boundary data from external sources. The map provides various base map options, including satellite, grayscale, and outdoors, and allows users to toggle earthquake markers and tectonic plate boundaries on and off.
